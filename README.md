# gc3's 5e Character Sheet

This is my rendtion of the 5e, default character sheet. Use Libre Office to
edit and fill out.

I found some sections not super useful to me, and I wanted something that was
easier to fill out digitally instead of a form fillable PDF. The key to this has
been **Libre Office**!

Thus, we have Libre Office imports of the 5e main sheet and spell list sheet
adjusted to be very easy to edit with a pen or with Libre Offce. You can also
export to PDF if you like, but I didn't go through the trouble of making it form
fillable for that use case.
